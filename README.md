# PMC_Wolfenstein3D
Pimp my code - Wolfenstein 3D old school project

## The base idea of Pimp my code
All PMC_ projects was founded to take old school project and refactor them to achieve few goals:
 - to be buildable on many platform by using cmake
 - code should be cleaner and more expansible
 - if the project use only one of the graphic library (OpenGL/DirectX), should support both

## Branches:
 - master: for base version of project
 - pmc: for ongoing works to make a code be cleaner & better
